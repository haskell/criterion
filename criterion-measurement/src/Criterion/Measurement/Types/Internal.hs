-- Along with Criterion.Types.nfIO' and Criterion.Types.whnfIO', the following
-- two functions are the core benchmarking loops. They have been carefully
-- constructed to avoid allocation while also evaluating @f x@.
--
-- Because these functions are pure, GHC is particularly smart about optimizing
-- them. We must turn off @-ffull-laziness@ to prevent the computation from
-- being floated out of the loop.
--
-- For a similar reason, these functions must not be inlined. There are two
-- possible issues that can arise if they are inlined. First, the work is often
-- floated out of the loop, which creates a nonsense benchmark. Second, the
-- benchmark code itself could be changed by the user's optimization level. By
-- marking them @NOINLINE@, the core benchmark code is always the same.
--
-- Finally, it's important that both branches of the loop depend on the state
-- token from the IO action. This is achieved by using `evaluate` rather than `let !y = f x`
-- in order to force the value to whnf. `evaluate` is in the IO monad and therefore the state
-- token needs to be passed through the loop.
--
-- See ghc#21948 where a change in eta-expansion behaviour
-- caused the work to be performed in the wrong place because the otherwise branch
-- did not depend on the state token at all, and the whole loop could be evaluated to
-- a single return function before being run in the IO monad.
--
-- See #183, #184 and #264 for discussion.
