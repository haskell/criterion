-- Types for benchmarking.
--
-- The core type is 'Benchmarkable', which admits both pure functions
-- and 'IO' actions.
--
-- For a pure function of type @a -> b@, the benchmarking harness
-- calls this function repeatedly, each time with a different 'Int64'
-- argument (the number of times to run the function in a loop), and
-- reduces the result the function returns to weak head normal form.
--
-- For an action of type @IO a@, the benchmarking harness calls the
-- action repeatedly, but does not reduce the result.

    Environment  :: NFData env
                 => IO env -> (env -> IO a) -> (env -> Benchmark) -> Benchmark
    Benchmark    :: String -> Benchmarkable -> Benchmark
    BenchGroup   :: String -> [Benchmark] -> Benchmark


-- | Run a benchmark (or collection of benchmarks) in the given
-- environment.  The purpose of an environment is to lazily create
-- input data to pass to the functions that will be benchmarked.
--
-- A common example of environment data is input that is read from a
-- file.  Another is a large data structure constructed in-place.
--
-- __Motivation.__ In earlier versions of criterion, all benchmark
-- inputs were always created when a program started running.  By
-- deferring the creation of an environment when its associated
-- benchmarks need the its, we avoid two problems that this strategy
-- caused:
--
-- * Memory pressure distorted the results of unrelated benchmarks.
--   If one benchmark needed e.g. a gigabyte-sized input, it would
--   force the garbage collector to do extra work when running some
--   other benchmark that had no use for that input.  Since the data
--   created by an environment is only available when it is in scope,
--   it should be garbage collected before other benchmarks are run.
--
-- * The time cost of generating all needed inputs could be
--   significant in cases where no inputs (or just a few) were really
--   needed.  This occurred often, for instance when just one out of a
--   large suite of benchmarks was run, or when a user would list the
--   collection of benchmarks without running any.
--
-- __Creation.__ An environment is created right before its related
-- benchmarks are run.  The 'IO' action that creates the environment
-- is run, then the newly created environment is evaluated to normal
-- form (hence the 'NFData' constraint) before being passed to the
-- function that receives the environment.
--
-- __Complex environments.__ If you need to create an environment that
-- contains multiple values, simply pack the values into a tuple.
--
-- __Lazy pattern matching.__ In situations where a \"real\"
-- environment is not needed, e.g. if a list of benchmark names is
-- being generated, a value which throws an exception will be passed
-- to the function that receives the environment.  This avoids the
-- overhead of generating an environment that will not actually be
-- used.
--
-- The function that receives the environment must use lazy pattern
-- matching to deconstruct the tuple (e.g., @~(x, y)@, not @(x, y)@),
-- as use of strict pattern matching will cause a crash if an
-- exception-throwing value is passed in.
--
-- __Example.__ This program runs benchmarks in an environment that
-- contains two values.  The first value is the contents of a text
-- file; the second is a string.  Pay attention to the use of a lazy
-- pattern to deconstruct the tuple in the function that returns the
-- benchmarks to be run.
--
-- > setupEnv = do
-- >   let small = replicate 1000 (1 :: Int)
-- >   big <- map length . words <$> readFile "/usr/dict/words"
-- >   return (small, big)
-- >
-- > main = defaultMain [
-- >    -- notice the lazy pattern match here!
-- >    env setupEnv $ \ ~(small,big) -> bgroup "main" [
-- >    bgroup "small" [
-- >      bench "length" $ whnf length small
-- >    , bench "length . filter" $ whnf (length . filter (==1)) small
-- >    ]
-- >  ,  bgroup "big" [
-- >      bench "length" $ whnf length big
-- >    , bench "length . filter" $ whnf (length . filter (==1)) big
-- >    ]
-- >  ] ]
--
-- __Discussion.__ The environment created in the example above is
-- intentionally /not/ ideal.  As Haskell's scoping rules suggest, the
-- variable @big@ is in scope for the benchmarks that use only
-- @small@.  It would be better to create a separate environment for
-- @big@, so that it will not be kept alive while the unrelated
-- benchmarks are being run.

    -> Benchmark
envWithCleanup = Environment

-- | Create a Benchmarkable where a fresh environment is allocated for every
-- batch of runs of the benchmarkable.
--
-- The environment is evaluated to normal form before the benchmark is run.
--
-- When using 'whnf', 'whnfIO', etc. Criterion creates a 'Benchmarkable'
-- whichs runs a batch of @N@ repeat runs of that expressions. Criterion may
-- run any number of these batches to get accurate measurements. Environments
-- created by 'env' and 'envWithCleanup', are shared across all these batches
-- of runs.
--
-- This is fine for simple benchmarks on static input, but when benchmarking
-- IO operations where these operations can modify (and especially grow) the
-- environment this means that later batches might have their accuracy effected
-- due to longer, for example, longer garbage collection pauses.
--
-- An example: Suppose we want to benchmark writing to a Chan, if we allocate
-- the Chan using environment and our benchmark consists of @writeChan env ()@,
-- the contents and thus size of the Chan will grow with every repeat. If
-- Criterion runs a 1,000 batches of 1,000 repeats, the result is that the
-- channel will have 999,000 items in it by the time the last batch is run.
-- Since GHC GC has to copy the live set for every major GC this means our last
-- set of writes will suffer a lot of noise of the previous repeats.
--
-- By allocating a fresh environment for every batch of runs this function
-- should eliminate this effect.
